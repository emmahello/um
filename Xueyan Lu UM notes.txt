Hi Dr. Takita, Xueyan Lu from dosimetry. WOuld you please re-approve the plan for GLORIA VELASQUEZ. 
Would you re-approve the plan? I'm sorry I didn't put a proper tracking point for QA. The plan is the same.
I see you in and out.
It (new Tx) starts at 2 pm. I just make sure you got my email.
give me an estimate??? I can talk to him
Please disregard last email.
In Annia’s absence I will be handling this case. 
This request is very time sensitive.
There are two plans ready for review. However, if you prefer to evaluate the sum prior to approval I have sent both plans to MIM so physics can generate a plan sum. I already dropped a task for them and cc'd them on this email.
From what I can see, Hayden and James are working on this patient. Adding them to the thread so they can provide updates.
The family is doing their effort on their side to expedite the process
Ask MD: The prostate is pushed up to the bladder. ... Is there any reason for that?
The second plan for one more fx retreat is 'L CW retreatment' since the patient is still in pain. 800cGy/fx * 1 fx = 800cGy.
This is Lu. I'm calling from University of Miami to request records for a patient that will be treated here. We have Authorization for Third Party Disclosures form with the physician's signature. Also I have the physician-to-physician request form. Can you please let me know what the process is? The patient's name is Enrique Rodriguez. Last name is Rodriguez. DOB 08/03/1954 Aug 3rd 1954
.. from Palmetto General? She got Radiation to the left upper lung in 2020. 
...Provider to Provider Release of Information for Treatment Purposes
...medical release form with the patient's signature
I faxed two documents to you yesterday. Did you receive my fax?
This is Lu. I'm calling from University of Miami to request records for a patient that will be treated here. I faxed two request forms on last Monday. Is there any update from the physics team? 
..Just double check the physics team is too busy to email me or they email to a wrong address
FRANCIS.SIMAC@USA.GENESISCARE.COM
Good morning Dr. Freret,

I hope you're doing well. I was wondering when you were planning to start this patient. I know you said you were going to request another MRI. I just wanted to know because I'm going to be off most of next week and I don't want anything to fall through the cracks. Please let me know. 

If they tell you that the form is enough, then ask for the fax number. If not, just follow what they tell you to do.

MRN: 23655765 VMAT Ethos by Rene
Breast w LN, PTV4800, PTV4256, SIM Tx, DIBH
01_CW_ARC 181 CW 50, 02_CCW_ARC 50 CCW 181, ...
NTO: pri 100, 0.3, 100%, 46%, 0.4
Select multiple PTV - 1 isocenter 4 half arcs
KVCBCT setup field only
Ethos's gantry rotation speed is 4 times than Linac
Change the half arcs's angle to 181 - 50
Ethos's big limitation is 28 cm only for FOV (Linac FOV is 40 cm); If > 28 cm, may use multiple isocenter.
Ethos has no jaw, only MLC
Two reference points, one RC in the center of PTV4800
Target is PTV4800, normalization to PTV4800 as well
Duplicate BODY in the free breath scan, Rename BODY as BODY_FB and copy it to the BH scan
Assign HU_water to scar wire if under bolus, otherwise assign HU_air to it.
OPTV_Low is PTV_combined cropped from PTV_High with NO margin
OPTV_Low upper 0% 103%Dose, lower 100% 102%Dose
PTV_High upper 0% 103%Dose, lower 100% 102%Dose
OLung is Lung
Ethos couch is at the bottom of the horizonal (not tilt) panel, double check in the saggital view
Delete the immoblization frame contour from Body near PTV, keep it only for the human body.
If the big circle of ethos touches the couch or Body (it will show a red circle), ask the therapist to re-send a new EXTENDED FIELD OF VIEW (to 850).
Double check the skin folder of the breast, if PTV includes air, un-contour the air part of the PTV. (Yes, dsmt can modify the PTV a little bit)

Tips from Katherine
PTV 100% 4800cGy 160, when in level 3, suddenly change it to PTV 100% 4900cGy 200
GTV 100% 103%Dose 100
PTV 100% 101%Dose 110
OAR               80

Tips from William
Delete the maximum dose in Rx for the lower PTV, only leave one for the higher PTV.
Delete the minimum dose at 95% in Rx, that's too much
General rules: SBRT maximum dose is around 120% - 125%. >135% is too high unless very small PTV volumes, <115% is too low unless no upper objective is added at all
		... most of time, we don't need minimum dose for all types of cases.
Check PET fusion before you start plan for HN and lung SBRT cases, in case MD miss target

Tips from Hayden
----Isotoxic plan: Learn from Hayden----
Isotoxic plan means OAR avoidance is more important than PTV coverage
ROI = OAR
OAR overlapps with CTV: crop the OAR from CTV and override it with the new OAR!
OAR overlaps with PTV:
	Create a Dueduden & PTV+1cm margin structure, put 0.1 3300cGy 70. Focus on the OAR area
	Create a Chestwall & PTV structure, put 0 100%Dose 140. Focus on the OAR area
	Create a OPTV = PTV - Chestwall, put 100% 101%Dose 150. Ignore the overlapping area's coverage. Improve other area's coverage
Add one more Arc at 90 degree. If you can, don't add more Arc.
Add PTV lower objective: 100% 102%IDSL 150??
Can't meet max < 115%, then put Body 0 112%Dose 1000 when in MR Level 3.
Can't meet V2500cGy < 0.4%, then put V2000cGy < 0.5%. Imagine there are two curves there, you try to shift the whole curve to left

-----regular plan from Hayden----
BODY:
	SBRT case: NTO 100 0.5cm 100% 50% 0.9, if 50%IDL is not ideal, change to 45% or even 40%; Ring 3/-2cm
	Non SBRT: NTO 100 0.5cm 100% 50% 0.3; no ring
Ring
	low dose spillage
		Ring wall 5cm/-2cm for conventional cases; wall 3cm/-2cm for SBRT cases
		Avoid = Body - PTV - ring (3/-2cm), put 0 49%IDL because we don't want see sporadic 50%IDL outside the ring.
	high dose spillage (100%IDL looks bad)
		Ring wall 0.8cm/-0.4cm
@@@@@SBRT&Palliative case's priority: nerve OAR (including spinal cord, brachialPlex, caudaEquina) > PTV coverage > other OAR
SBRT or weird shape PTV: start from 3 arcs by default
Avoid radiation going through arm: contour arm with 0.5cm
Spinal Cord max 1800cGy (PTV3000_spine)
	(1-18/30)*2 = 8mm
	optiPTV3000_spine = crop PTV3000_spine from spinal cord with 5mm margin
	Crop spinal cord, leave the length only the same long as the PTV with no margin
PTV2500
	100% 102%Dose 100
	0% 104%Dose 120
Heart max 2800cGy, heart overlaps with PTV:
	Heart&PTV 0% 2650cGy 70
	Heart - (PTV+0.5cm) mean 1000cGy 60 --- push not hard at all
Liver overlaps with PTV but not in constraints:
	Liver - (PTV+0.5cm) mean 400cGy 60 --- push not hard at all

-----from Gus----
HN patient MRN: 10139847

2_ARC 10	15.0 7.5 7.5
3_ARC 90	14.2 -0.5 13.7	-- it only covers PTV6600 and part of PTV5940 and parotid areas, not cover full of PTV5445.

-----VMAT Breast w LN----
DANIA, MRN: 21665995
Four half arcs
Change the gantry angle to 181-55
Fit the  collimator
Change the field size as below:
	Arc_1 181-55 	5 	Field X: 15	X1:-7.5	X2:7.5		input 15 in the field X, cover superior and inferior
	Arc_2 55-181 	355	Field X: 15	X1:-7.5	X2:7.5		input 15 in the field X, cover superior and inferior
	Arc_3 181-55 	85 	Field X: 15	X1:-3	X2:12		change the X1, cover lateral of the upper part
	Arc_4 55-181 	95 	Field X: 15	X1:-11.7 X2:3.2		change the X2, cover lateral of the lower part
Always put 100% lower object, such as 100% 93%Dose 80. If you put 99.5%, even put very high dose, small corner PTV could be not covered at all.
Put 100% lower object to PTV_SCL and PTV_CW
Put 0% upper object to PTV_CW
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Case Study ---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1350 cGy * 1 fx case is sent to MD to review, he thinks the 50% ISL is not safe, so he change it to 2500 cGy in 5 fx.
3D plan is too hot (128%), Karen changed the prescription from 95% - 100 % to 95% to 95 %, and mentioned it in the review email to MD.
Large MU duty cycle:
	MU duty cycle is 9, way more larger than 5. Total MU / Daily Dose should be less than 5.
	1. Add one more Arc
	2. MU Objective, set maximum MU as Daily dose * 5 (2500 = 500cGy * 5), strength is from 0 to 100, which is the priority for MU Objective. Check MU number while optimizing! 
	... If MU total is required less than 4000, you can put 5000 priority 50 because you can go a little larger than 5 and don't want to hurt the plan
	3. Try to use 10x instead of 10xFFF, Try to use 10x instead of 6x
	4. Set min MU
	5. LinacA should be < 5 strictly!!! Other machines prefer < 5 but could be around 6
	6. Re-optimization from ML level 1 (instead of from ML level 3) could be helpful to reduce the MU
	7. Change SRS Arc Therapy to Arc Therapy if not SBRT cases
DIBH
	DIBH was written in Prescription and in physician's order; However, in some reason she was only scanned in free breath. I planned in the free breath CT and sent it to MD approval but I forgot to change Gating:DIBH to Gating:None.
Field X size for large volumes
	Set 4 full arcs - change collimator angles - Arc Geometry Tool - Fit Collimator to Target - change Field X, X1, and X2.
	Field ID 	Gantry Rtn	Field X		X1	X2 	Field Y
	Arc_1		30		15		7.5	7.5	22		cover lateral
	Arc_2		330		15		7.5	7.5	22		cover lateral
	Arc_3		90		15		-15	0	22		cover superial
	Arc_4		90		15		0	15	22		cover inferior

3D for large volumes on Edge
	AP and PA
	click I in front of PA in the Group column - create a new group
	change SSD of AP to 100 - MLC - Fit to structure - check whether PTV fit inside of FOV
	same to PA
	Calculate
	Norm to 100%-95%
	Adjust field weighting, look at the volume with dose >110% and the max dose. We finally adjusted AP 48% and PA 52%
	Add a FIF, if D0.03cc>115%, that's not acceptable, add more FIF. We finally got 108%
		when move MLC, an error prompted saying distance limitation; so I move the X2 jaw close to isocenter, then try again
		when done, merge subfields
	Since the plan have two isocenters, we need to split them into two plans
		change the norm from 100%-95% to 'Plan Normalization Value:69.45%'
		copy the plan into three plans: DNU_SUM, Iliac_R_AP (delete PA fields), Iliac_R_PA (delete AP fields)
		in Iliac_R_AP plan:
			new structure with 50%IDL, and new structure named opti_PTV2000_ANT ( = PTV2000 & 50%IDL) -- Don't why this step????
			new reference point named PTV2000_ANT (no location, check Target, fill the dose, set as the primary reference point)
			new reference point named RC_ANT (put it inside the opti_PTV2000_ANT)
		in Iliac_R_PA plan:
			same
		insert a plan sum and ask MD to approve it.

Dr. Iscow doesn't put dose limits, he prefers ALARA
Dr. Takita prefers good PTV conformility, eg. tight 100% IDL. Doesn't like a 3D beam perpendicular to lungs or heart.
Dr. Reveda prefers high coverage as long as OAR is fine.
Dr. Yechieli: when you plan Dr. Yechieli, you are the Doctor.
Dr. Spieler perfers 50%IDL irradiates bladder ALARA, 33%IDL irradiates rectum ALARA. Carina is best for upper and mid lung cases.

--------Doral---------
Therapist Martinez, Rene phone: 20150
Since the simulation CT machine has more bits (16 bits) than other CT machines (12 bits), HU could overflow in electron density curve. If got an error during calculation, then in Contouring, 
... click 'Segment High Density Artifacts', it will recognize all areas whose HU is larger than 3388, you reassign HU as 3093 or a type of material, such as Titanium (HU=8000), and steel (HU=13000?).
4DCT in Doral don't combine as a scan named 'CTSim 0% - 90%' with 2000 slices, in converse, it separates into 12?? CT scans, such as CTSim 0%, CTSim 10%,.... You choose a phase (such as 50%) to fuse PET to it.
Identify
	Some of the server are not talking to our Identify server. You can check you citrix connection center, UH01VARNCTXP01-05 usually works. Others usually doesn’t. This is not because of any connection issue, but just these servers need to reboot.

--------English---
There's no DICOM that we are aware of. We don't have acess to EPIC DICOM.
I apologize for using the wrong pronoun. I did not mean any disrespect.

--------Plan------
if override HU, rename the structure as HU_3888_SurgicalClips, HU_-993_BBs, etc
At least: 95% of PTV2000 at 100% of 2000cGy ==> CC: V100% >= 95%
can not meet minimum dose
	min>= 90% can change to Min Dose Volume: MinD0.03cc >= 90%, OR even change to MinD1% >= 90%
	new structure, contour three slices, one of which is the superior or inferior of the PTV

Avoid radiating through arms because arms are easy to move then the dose will not be accurate

-----contour----
Strip_skin: 1 cm thick of skin
CW: 3 cm thick
Bowel_Bag: barely use Bowel in this hospital, almost all Bowel_Bag. If it overlaps with PTV, then crop it from CTV only, not from expension.
LiverEff = Liver - CTV_liver

-----Dose limits----
SBRT Liver: Liverr-GTV (for non-cirrhotic liver) mean dose < 15 - 17 Gy
V3200cGy < 30cc
V3000cGy < 70cc

------MIM------

	•	For Halcyon, move the user origin closer to the treatment isocenter in the Treatment Planning System to reduce the Delta Couch Shift longitudinal value so that the Load button becomes available
	•	The planned longitudinal Delta Couch Shift cannot exceed: 
		o	-17.00cm (moves the couch away from the bore)
		o	OR
		o	+30.00cm (moves the couch further into bore) 
		o	These limits are documented in the Halcyon and Ethos Radiotherapy System Customer Release Note
	•	For Ethos, move the Simulation Isocenter in the Technical Structures to be within 17cm of the planned isocenter
	example:
		one lesion in superior: Y=-5cm; the other lesion in inferior: Y=-52cm. User origin: Y=-10cm
		Create a new structure named Virtual_Iso_shift: put is at Y=22cm, use brush (2 cm thick, check 3D) to contour one dot in one slice.
		Setup notes: use virtual_iso_shift as a user origin
		Ethos report: create an OAR structure virtual_iso_shift and link it.
		Simulation Isocenter - Edit - click square-arrow - choose virtual_iso_shift - Confirm

---field x size ---
keep it less than 14.5 for IMRT; 3D don't care about the field x size, the field will be split into multiple carriage groups
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ If the machine have jaw tracking feature (eg. all Truebeam machines have it), then field X could be larger than 20 cm. However, considering replan in a different machine, we prefer to keep less than 14.5 even in Truebeam.

---normalization--
100% of dose covers 95% of target = Dxx > 100% (D95% > 100% ) = Vxx > 95% (V100% > 95%) = At least: 95% of PTV2500 at 100% of 2500cGy

---GPU---
When optimizing Hyper Arc plans, please avoid using GPU as it doesn’t support optimization with high resolution (1.25mm) and it switches it to standard 2.5mm resolution for optimization. 
Since hyper arc optimization defaults to 1.25mm optimization, if GPU is checked it will change to standard without prompt. As always, the final dose calculation should be performed using 1.25mm resolution.
I spoke to Varian yesterday and this will be changed in version 18, albeit potentially leading to memory issues. In the meantime, turn off GPU for Hyper Arc plans, and this will probably give you better plans especially when there are very small targets.

@@@@DO NOT check GPU for SRS and SBRT cases.

Fusion tips:
	MRI prostate only focuses the prostate area and rectum, all softtissue matters, don't care about pelvic bone.
	PET/CT in UM always has two sets, one set of arms up, the other set of arms down. Only import the arms down (not the one with the most slices or the one with marks), which arms' position is the same as that during tx.
	PET/CT: look at the PETCT MIP black and white series. Those dark spots are enhancement spots. If the dark spots only exist on the small area, then focus on that area to fuse; 
	... elseif the dark spots expand on different areas, such as oral cavity and lower neck, then fuse on the large area and need a deformable fusion.

	Rx (PTV7020 and GTV7720): 17 fractions; note: 17 fractions treated using PTV7020 (dose of 4590cGy) as well as GTV7720 (dose of 5047.7 cGy). Keep all OAR constraints. Keep the PTV name, such as PTV7020_ProstateSV.
	Rx (PTV7020): 9 fractions; note: Remaining 9 fractions using only PTV7020 due to increasing urinary issues. Keep all OAR constraints. Keep the PTV name, such as PTV7020_ProstateSV.
2. Copy the old prostate as 17 TXD; New a prostate_new plan with 9 fractions, use the PTV7020 reference point only (remove the GTV7720 ref point).
3. Plan Sum
4. Complete the old prostate completed early, ...., just as other replan cases do.

---------------------------------------Hypo notes--------------------------------
•	External beam cases delivering high dose radiation in 1 fraction greater than (but NOT equal to) 8Gy and that are defined as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) require a hypofractionation note.
•	External beam cases delivering 2-5 treatments that are defined as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or treatments with doses greater than (but NOT equal to) 5 Gy per fraction regardless of the technique, require a hypofractionation note.
•	External beam cases delivering 5 Gy per fraction only require a hypofractionation note when delivered as SBRT.  Thus 25 Gy in 5 fractions delivered with standard radiation for pelvic, GI, spine and brain tumors do not require hypofractionation notes.
•	This policy excludes standard palliative or prophylactic radiation treatments delivered with convention 3D conformal radiotherapy or IMRT/VMAT that are not considered SBRT or SRS. Thus, excluded from this policy are “quad shots” of 14.8 Gy in 4 fractions delivered BID over 2 days, and 7 or 8 Gy in 1 fraction.
•	Any treatment that delivers more 5 Gy or more per day to a previously irradiated area requires a hypofractionation note, including “Quad shots”, 25 Gy in 5 fractions, or 7 or 8 GY in 1 fraction.
•	The attending radiation oncologist must review the case with a co-signing attending physician. This review should take place after volumes and prescriptions are approved but prior to treatment planning.  The hypofractionation note must be signed prior to the first treatment.
•	Final treatment plans will be reviewed at the weekly new patient conference.  Please note that because large fraction sizes are routine in the setting of brachytherapy, this policy will not apply to brachytherapy cases.
•	Intracranial SRS performed using gammaknife or linear accelerator that has a neurosurgeon involved in the case is exempt from this policy as long as the neurosurgeon is involved in the target delineation and treatment planning.  The neurosurgeon will document his/her involvement in a note in UCHART.
**SBRT 5Gy/fx need hypo note; IMRT 5Gy/fx doesn't need it.

Good morning William, 
My name is Jacqueline Canut and I am an intake coordinator for Radiation Oncology at the Miami Cancer Institute. I am reaching out to you in efforts of obtaining some radiation records for a mutual patient. 
... My colleague Ericka Guido has shared your email with me in hopes for assistance with these records. Above I have attached the request form with what we are looking for along with the ROI from the patient. 
... Please let me know if you are able to assist or have any questions or concerns. Thank you so much and I look forward to hearing back from you. This patient is scheduled to come in early next week so it is 
... a STAT request. Wishing you a very happy holiday season! 
Best, 
Jackie

Target labelling
1.	New targets: X. GTV[Dose(cGy)] [Location] where X is the number of the target, prescribed dose in cGy, and location including laterality, (e.g., “1. GTV2100_R Parietal”)
2.	Previously treated targets: X. GTV[Dose]^tx’d_date (e.g., X. GTV[Dose]^YYYY_MM)
3.	Re-treating a previously treated target: X. GTV[Dose(cGy)] _[Location]^retx (e.g., re-treated 10. GTV2100 = 10. GTV2100_L Parietal^retx)
4.	Gross tumor recurring in a resection cavity:  X. GTVsb[Dose(cGy)]_[Location]
@Physics, when registering the MRI to the planning CT of a previously treated patient and after transferring the previous targets to the new CT, please re-label accordingly. It will simply be adding a suffix to the already labeled target with the treated date (YYYY_MM format).
